# A Translation of Hankel's *Vorlesungen*

This is a work-in-progress English translation of Hermann Hankel's
1867 *Vorlesungen Ã¼ber die complexen Zahlen und ihre Functionen, I.
Theil: Theorie der Complexen Zahlensysteme* ("Lectures on complex
numbers and their functions, Part I: Theory of Complex Number
Systems"), a textbook on complex analysis that played an important
role in the transition to modern mathematics in nineteenth century
Germany.

You can view the translation in its present state
[here](https://wyleyr.github.io/hankel1867tr/).

The original text, with sometimes-workable OCR, is available from the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/vorlesungenberd01hankgoog/).

## Goals

Hankel's book is not very well known today, even among philosophers
and historians of mathematics, but it was an important work in its
time. For example, in Frege's *Grundlagen der Arithmetik*
("Foundations of arithmetic"), which *is* widely read among anglophone
philosophers today, Hankel is Frege's most frequently cited
interlocutor. Frege scholarship could learn a lot from Hankel, but
because Hankel's text is difficult and hasn't been translated, it
hasn't received much attention. By making this translation available,
I am hoping to make the work more accessible to an English-speaking
audience (and their search engines and browsers).

I am also using the project to experiment with the possibilities of
publishing a translation in a "hypertext-first" format: linking to
works Hankel cites, representing his formulas in MathML, showing the
original phrase for certain translations in mouse-over text, and so
on. Because digital texts are hard to cite by traditional means (e.g.
with page numbers), I am also taking care to encode the features of
the original text in the markup. See [MARKUP.md](./MARKUP.md) for more
information about how these features are represented.

At the moment, it is not my goal to translate the whole book, which is
mostly just a mathematics textbook that is by now outdated. Its
interest lies mainly in its historical importance and in the
philosophical approach to the foundations of mathematics which Hankel
sets out in the initial chapters of the book. The translation is
focused on these initial chapters.
